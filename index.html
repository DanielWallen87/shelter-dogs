      <h2>Meet Daniel</h2> 
      <p>Daniel Wallen is 100% obsessed with dogs. He loves them so much that he's taken more than fifty shelter dogs on a walk within the last year. After sharing their photos on social media, approximately 80% of them got placed in a home. His hometown newspaper recently published a front-page story about his efforts. <a href="http://www.timesnews.net/Local/2019/08/04/Kingsport-man-adopts-a-dog-s-perspective-on-life.html" target="_blank">Click here to read the article at Kingsport Times-News Online.</a></p>

      <!-- <p>Spending time with dogs became a form of therapy for Daniel, who was diagnosed with bipolar disorder in the winter of 2018. He suffered a manic episode that distorted his perceptions, caused him to become paranoid, and ultimately led to an encounter with law enforcement. Since Daniel's ordeal had more to do with an undiagnosed mental illness than criminal behavior (he had a squeaky clean record until then), his charges are being dismissed and expunged. For a longer version of this story, click here to read his guest post on Body for Wife.</p>

      <p>Although he's walked every breed of shelter dog imaginable -- including chihuahuas, dachshunds, beagles, hounds, shepherds, rottweilers, retrievers, and even a Great Pyrenees -- his #1 favorite dog breed is the pit bull. Daniel has a soft spot for pit bulls, because they are unfairly discriminated against. Due to flawed studies and dishonest media, many people believe pit bulls are innately aggressive. This is far from the truth. Every pit bull Daniel's ever met (note: he's walked about 20 of them) has been calm and gentle. But they are also strong and powerful. Chihuahuas are more likely to bite you than a pit bull. However, if the pit bull bites, they'll do more damage. See the difference?</p> -->

      <p>Lambda School invited Daniel to join their Web 22 cohort, which started in June. This intensive nine month program will prepare him for a new career in web design and development. In case you didn't guess, concepts he's learned about were applied to this shelter dog website. Enjoy!

# Shelter Dogs (Adoption App/Website)

Note: I've done extensive market research and planning for a similar but separate app/website that will eventually replace this one. In the meanwhile, I'm leaving this code as it is (even though the mobile responses for medium-sized screens desperately need attention).

My favorite volunteering activity = walking shelter dogs. I also post their photos on Facebook and share with animal rescue groups to speed up the adoption process. The goal here was to make a product that will achieve that goal more effectively.

This structure is similar to what I hope to accomplish with a much better app, which I'll devote days and weeks to coding (versus hours). Shelters will be able to submit the info in a similar card-like format for each adoptable dog or cat.

## How the Website Works

- Desktop view is decently on point (minus the horizontal scroll, which I'd eliminate if I planned to use the site).
- Switching to mobile changes the flex-direction of each card to "column" for a more attractive view.
- Social media links on the bottom are current. Feel free to connect on any of those platforms.
